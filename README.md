Another project built as part of an Angular training on Alura.  

## What is this project and what does it do? ðŸ¤”

Memorando is task manager. Users can create, edit, search and delete tasks, as well as marking them as finished.  

Memorando uses Angular's *animations module* to create animations that improve users' experience by providing feedback on their actions and highlighting the application's flow of actions.

## How was it made and what technologies does it use? ðŸ§°

Following technologies were used to develop this project:  

- **Angular**
- **TypeScript**
- **RxJS**
- **Node.js**
- **JSON Server**

*An initial Angular project was provided by Alura*, including Memorando's basic structure and its components, visual assets and CSS code.  

JSON Server was used to mock an API and animations were created using Angular's animations module, which provides functions such as *trigger*, *state*, *style*, *transition* and *animate*.
